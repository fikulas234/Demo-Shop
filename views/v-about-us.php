              <h4>How it started</h4>
              <p>
              It began with a reckless challenge  to the conventional wisdom of the day, 
a developer's belief that  it was possible to construct a watch  that wouldn't break, 
even if dropped, Project Team Tough was formed  to build it in 1981.
The team created  over 200 prototypes  one after another over a period  of about two years.
They finally arrived at  a shock-resistant structure. 
This marked  the birth of a technology  that is tough to the core.

              <h4>Our Mission</h4>
              <p>
              Today, the development team's  passionate challenge 
and constant efforts  have reached fruition  in Triple G Resist, 
a structure with the strength  to withstand 3 types  of gravitational acceleration.

In its pursuit of usability  under any circumstances,  moreover, 
G-SHOCK realized installation  of Smart Access,  a system assuring agile,  reliable operability.

Stronger than ever,  and targeting even greater strength, 
G-SHOCK's challenge is never-ending.
