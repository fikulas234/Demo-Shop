My first project in PHP. It is a demo shop. I learned a lot doing this, what's left to do is to implement checkout functionality from shopping cart, remove some bugs and do everything in OOP.

Project is more complete now as it now have products that are connected with mysql base, checkout functionality from shopping cart and code is now more in OOP style.
